That's all.
Lesson first before pop quiz Ms. huhu T-T.
Let the teacher handle this class as knowledgeable as Ms. because some of my friends from the other block claims that their teacher doesn't teaches the properly and just let them self-study which is hard on this course.
Ms. is a very good teacher.
She treats her students well.
no additional comment.

She has to change her style in having pop quiz first before discussing the topics tackled in the pop quiz.
Because there are students who doesnt study without a given notes by the teacher.
